# /security-pass — security contract

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Critical rules

1. Use `security-champion` + `@[skills/security-review]`
2. If creating `02` from scratch → copy § Document stub from `.agent/references/templates/phase-docs/02-security.md`
3. Read checklist for active mode before Write on `02_security.md`
4. Relevant decisions → `prepend-decision` (read `update-decisions-log` skill)
5. Do not silently approve architecture `approved` if critical gaps remain open
6. **HAR:** console signup, OAuth app registration, or regulator portals → stop with HAR block; read-only official docs (ANPD, EUR-Lex) need no account

---

## Modes (`$ARGUMENTS`)

| Argument | Mode | Action |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| _(empty)_ | **full** | `checklists.md` + `security-doc-checklist.md` on entire `02` |
| `bootstrap` | **bootstrap** | Read `01_tech_stack.md` → `security-bootstrap.md` → fill `02` sections |
| `US-XXXX` | **us-align** | Load US `--full`; map security Acceptance → `02` sections |
