## How the harness is layered

```txt
Human (manager)
    ↓ approves direction, sets approved / ✅
Slash command (/create-us)  →  opens workflow in .agent/workflows/
    ↓ assigns persona
Agent (@backlog-refiner)       →  .agent/agents/{name}.md
    ↓ executes procedure
Skill (create-user-story)   →  .agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md
    ↓ writes artifacts
docs/                       →  source of truth
```

| Layer | Role | You invoke |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| **Workflow** | Step-by-step recipe for one command | `/status`, `/create-us` |
| **Agent** | Domain persona with gates and output format | Automatic routing or `@agent-name` |
| **Skill** | Repeatable procedure (templates, scripts) | Used by agent — rarely typed by human |

**Routing:** describe the task in chat → agent announces `Applying knowledge from @[agent]…`. Override anytime with `@scrum-master`, `@backlog-refiner`, etc.

**Priority:** P0 rules → MERIDIAN.md → agent → skill → templates.

## Agent groups

Eleven agents in **seven groups**. One agent may appear in notes when it supports another group.

### Group 1 — Orchestration

Keeps you as manager. Gates phases, reports blockers, decides what can move next.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`scrum-master`** | Project health, phase progression, “can we advance?”, init, daily loop | All `docs/` (read), decision log | Invent MVP code; approve docs; mark ✅ without Record |

**When to use:** `/status`, `/init-meridian`, `/daily-with-ai`, vague “what next?”, before any implementation.

**Skills:** `init-project`, `create-epic`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

### Group 2 — Scope & framing

Defines *what the product is* before structure and code.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`product-owner`** | Problem, users, in/out of scope, assumptions, risks | `docs/00_scope.md`, scope decisions | Tech stack, architecture, US |

**When to use:** drafting or challenging `00_scope`, scope arguments, “is this in scope?”

**Skills:** `init-project`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

### Group 3 — Documentation & phase docs

Writes and reviews phase documents and product-facing docs agents can execute.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`technical-writer`** | Phase docs `01`–`04`, `06`–`08`, `11`; epic drafting | `docs/01_*` … `docs/08_*` | Approve `status: approved`; implement code |

**When to use:** filling tech stack, principles, environments; `/create-epic` (with templates).

**Skills:** `init-project`, `create-epic`, `create-user-story`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

### Group 4 — Security & architecture

Hardens structure before backlog and implementation.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`security-champion`** | Threat model, secrets, OWASP, AI-agent safety, Git hygiene | `docs/02_security.md` | Skip security to ship faster |
| **`technical-architect`** | System boundaries, modules, integrations, consistency | `docs/05_architecture.md` | Architecture before scope/security drafts exist |

**When to use:** `/security-pass`, `/architecture`, security review before merge.

**Skills:** `security-review`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing` (+ `security-review` on technical-architect)

**Gate:** `05_architecture.md` must be **`approved`** before epics/versions/US (enforced by `sprint-planner` and `backlog-refiner`).

---

### Group 5 — Delivery planning

Turns approved architecture into releases, sprints, and execution order.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`sprint-planner`** | Versions, sprints, MoSCoW, go-live checklist, story sequencing | SQLite `versions`, `sprints` | Create US before architecture approved |

**When to use:** `/create-version`, `/plan-sprint`, roadmap and sprint scope.

**Skills:** `create-epic`, `create-version`, `create-sprint`, `create-user-story`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

### Group 6 — Board & user stories

Owns the executable backlog and honest execution state.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`backlog-refiner`** | US lifecycle, dependencies, close with evidence | SQLite `user_stories` | Implement without `ready: true`; mark ✅ without Record |

**When to use:** `/create-us`, `/review-us`, `/refine-us`, `/complete-us`, kanban consistency.

**Skills:** `create-user-story`, `review-user-story`, `refine-user-story`, `complete-user-story`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

### Group 7 — Code investigation (read-only)

Trace flows and explain behavior before refine, spike, or architecture updates.

| Agent | Serves for | Primary artifacts | Does not |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **`code-investigator`** | How code works, where logic lives, flow traces | Investigation report (chat) | Product code; US/epic without manager ask |

**When to use:** `/investigate`, "how does X work?", before `/refine-us` when Plan needs code facts.

**Skills:** `investigate-codebase`, `update-decisions-log`, `meridian-routing`

---

## Slash command groups

Slash command groups — workflows in **six groups**. Each maps to one primary agent (sometimes two).

### Group A — Bootstrap

| Step | Command | Agent | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ------------ |
| A1 | **`/init-meridian`** | `scrum-master` | Creates `docs/` tree, initial scope, decision log, empty board. **Mode B (existing codebase):** also `docs/inventory/as-is.md` — transitional capability map; no retroactive US. **No product code.** |

---

### Group B — Session & orientation

| Step | Command | Agent | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ------------ |
| B1 | **`/status`** | `scrum-master` | Read-only health: kit root, Meridian projects (multi-`docs/` repos), active product, phase doc statuses, US counts, blockers. |
| B2 | **`/daily-with-ai`** | `scrum-master` | Guided session: status → pick story → implement → close → sync. |
| B3 | **`/agents-help`** | `scrum-master` | Opens this reference; summarizes groups and current-step hints. |

---

### Group C — Phase documents (structure)

Complete in order: `00` → `01` → `02` → `03` → `04` → **`05`** → `06` → `07` → `08`.

| Step | Command | Agent | Target doc | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------ |
| C1 | *(conversation)* | `product-owner` | `00_scope.md` | Scope, users, out of scope. |
| C2 | *(conversation)* | `technical-writer` | `01`, `03`, `04`, `06`–`08` | Draft phase documents. |
| C3 | **`/security-pass`** | `security-champion` | `02_security.md` | Threat model, secrets, OWASP, agent safety. |
| C3b | **`/privacy-pass`** | `security-champion` | `02_security.md` § LGPD + GDPR | Brazil (ANPD) and EU (EDPB) privacy sections; official refs in checklist. **Doc only.** |
| C4 | **`/architecture`** | `technical-architect` | `05_architecture.md` + optional `docs/architecture/` | Overview, index, detail files; gate for backlog. |
| C5 | **`/design-pass`** | `design-system-owner` | `09_design_system.md` | Contract: tokens, stack, components. Modes: `bootstrap`, `US-XXXX`. **Doc only.** |
| C6 | **`/design-showcase`** | `design-system-owner` | `09` § Showcase + US drafts | Plan catalog routes; creates showcase US for `developer`. **No code.** |
| C7 | **`/design-review`** | `design-system-owner` | Report | Audit live UI vs `09` + showcase. **No code.** |
| C8 | **`/security-review`** | `security-champion` | Report | Audit code vs `02` + US security acceptance. **No code.** |
| C9 | **`/dependency-audit`** | `security-champion` | Report | Lockfiles and supply chain hygiene. **No code.** |
| C10 | **`/test-pass`** | `quality-owner` | `10_test_strategy.md` | Pyramid, runners, coverage. Modes: `bootstrap`, `US-XXXX`. **Doc only.** |
| C11 | **`/test-review`** | `quality-owner` | Report | Audit US tests vs strategy before close. **No code.** |
| C12 | **`/seo-pass`** | `seo-strategy` + `technical-writer` | `12_marketing_seo.md` | Public web only — meta, sitemap, CWV. **Doc only.** Skip CLI-only. |
| C13 | **`/investigate`** | `code-investigator` | Report | Read-only codebase trace and explanation. **No code.** |
| C14 | **`/discover`** | `product-owner` | `docs/discovery/product-brief.md` | Product discovery before scope. **No code.** |
| C15 | **`/document-project`** | `technical-writer` | `docs/` + `inventory/as-is.md` | Brownfield baseline in phase docs. **No US.** |
| C16 | **`/audit-docs`** | `technical-writer` | Report | Phase docs depth and drift vs code. **Report only** unless `apply`. |

**HAR (ação humana necessária):** agents stop for external accounts, OAuth/PAT, billing, production credentials — see `rules/MERIDIAN.md`. Not a slash command; applies during any workflow.

**UI products:** create `09` stub at `/init-meridian` when stack has UI. Run `/design-pass bootstrap` after `01_tech_stack`. Human approves `09` before Must UI US ship.

**Tested products:** create `10` stub when automated tests in scope. Run `/test-pass bootstrap` after `01_tech_stack`.

**Human gate:** you set `status: approved` on each doc. Agent never sets `approved`.

---

### Group D — Backlog artifacts

**Prerequisite:** `05_architecture.md` is **`approved`**.

| Step | Command | Agent | Output | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| D1 | **`/create-epic`** | `product-owner` | `EPIC-XX` in SQLite | Product capability block. |
| D2 | **`/create-version`** | `sprint-planner` | `vX` in SQLite | Release grouping epics/US. |
| D3 | **`/plan-sprint`** | `sprint-planner` | `vX-SY` in SQLite | Time-boxed goal + story list. |
| D4 | **`/complete-sprint vX-SY`** | `sprint-planner` | sprint `status: complete` | Sprint review + Retrospective filled. |

Order: **Epic → Version → User story** (backlog) → **`/plan-sprint`** (US on sprint) → **`/refine-us`** → **`/implement-us`** → **`/complete-sprint`** when increment delivered.

Epic/version **close:** set `status: complete` manually when outcome reached (no `/complete-epic` workflow).

---

### Group E — User story lifecycle

| Step | Command | Agent | US state after | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | -------------- | ------------ |
| E1 | **`/create-us`** | `backlog-refiner` | `ready: false` | New US: Intent + draft Plan. |
| E2 | **`/review-us US-XXXX`** | `backlog-refiner` | unchanged | Read-only quality audit. No `ready` change. |
| E3 | **`/refine-us US-XXXX`** | `backlog-refiner` | `ready: true` | Approach, arch refs, concrete tests; US on sprint. **Gate for code.** |
| E4 | **`/implement-us US-XXXX`** | `developer` | — | Gate: `ready: true`, deps, Plan; then product code. **Block if not refined.** |
| E5 | *(manager review)* | human | — | Review diff and run tests. |
| E6 | **`/complete-us US-XXXX`** | `backlog-refiner` | `status: ✅` | Fills Record, checks acceptance (SQLite upsert). |

**Rules:** no code without E3 (`ready: true`) **and** E4 gate. No ✅ without E6 (`## Record` + evidence).

---

### Group F — Decisions & validation

| Step | Command / action | Agent / tool | What it does |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| F1 | **`/update-decisions-log`** | any + skill | `prepend-decision` in SQLite. Run `date` first. Never edit old rows. |
| F2 | **`validate_meridian.py`** | script | `python3 .agent/scripts/validate_meridian.py <project-root>` — structure, US contracts, board. |
| F3 | **Meridian: Validate Project** *(extension)* | IDE command | Same validator from VS Code/Cursor sidebar. |

## IDE extension commands (separate layer)

These are **not** agents. They read the **active** `docs/` in the editor (extension `app-visual-studio`). In monorepos, **one active project** at a time — see [usage-guide.md § Multiple Meridian projects](./usage-guide.md#multiple-meridian-projects).

| Group | Command | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Views | **Open Board**, **Open Versions**, **Open Sprints**, **Open Epics**, **Open Decisions** | Board: 📋 Backlog · 📌 Todo · 🔶 Partial · 🧪 Tests · ✅ Done (from `status` + `ready` + tests); toggles 🧊 Frozen · 🚫 Deprecated. Other tabs read-only; **Project** row shows name + `docs/` path |
| Governance | **Select Active Project**, **Validate Project**, **Sync Board**, **Show Workspace Status** | Switch product (saved); validate `packageRoot`; board JSON; list all projects |
| Help | **Open Command Help**, **Open Agents Help** | Extension catalog; kit `agents-help.md` at runtime |

**Multi-product UI:** Board and Deliverables show which `docs/` is loaded; dropdown switches product and refreshes open tabs. Status bar shows project name when N>1. Install: Marketplace **Meridian Harness** or `pnpm install:cursor` in `app-visual-studio/`.
