# Meridian kit authoring

> **Maintainers:** use skill **`create-meridian-artifact`** (`.agent/skills/create-meridian-artifact/SKILL.md`) for the full procedure — skill, agent, workflow, registries, sync, validate.

This file is the lightweight entry point symlinked as `meridian-authoring` in IDE adapters.

## Skill folder layout

```txt
.agent/skills/skill-name/
  SKILL.md          # required — index + procedure
  references/       # optional — templates, long checklists
  scripts/          # optional
  assets/           # optional
```

| Scope | Path |
| ----- | ---- |
| Kit (this repo) | `meridian/.agent/skills/` |
| Client project | `<root>/.agent/skills/` |
| Cursor mirror | `<root>/.cursor/skills/` — **sync only, do not edit** |

## Minimal skill frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does X in Meridian. Use when user asks for X.
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep
---
```

Rules: `name` = folder name (kebab-case); `description` includes triggers.

---

## Layers

| Layer | Path | Role |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Workflow | `.agent/workflows/{cmd}.md` | Slash command recipe |
| Agent | `.agent/agents/{name}.md` | Persona, gates, output |
| Skill | `.agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | Repeatable procedure |

**Order when adding a full operator:** skill → agent → workflow → registries → sync.
